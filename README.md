# ITEL203-MidtermRequirement
Responsive website project for ITEL 203 Midterm Requirement

# IWEAR
IWear was inspired or suggested by Stella Montesines to me when we were tasked to create an e-commerce static site before. Thus, me a human being who is in need and use eye glasses to see clearly grab that opportunity to create a website that would help people select frames and customize lens that they like through online means. This is not for a specific business rather it was imaginative but is applicable to the real-world. 
The main colors that I use are cool to the eyes for easy navigations, and only use colors that are popping like red, maroon, and,  yellow for important flags like the delete and the tags for sale, new or limited items.  I used gradient colors to make the hero section of the home page to pop and used black and white reversely. Used the Japanese known technique design bento-box wherein the elements’ positions are based on bento boxes designs like the main content is the biggest then the supporting details are small but visible but doesn’t overwhelm the main content.
I had big troubles for the responsiveness because some images that I had used are too big thus it sometimes override the CSS styles and the Bootstrap Framework. To address this, I added the “@media” code in all the CSS files to ensure that all the elements are responsive to any screen size. I also use a mix of inline, internal and external CSS to ensure that some elements don’t get randomly resized.
I got confused when I start connecting or linking the pages through the buttons and navbar. To address this, I retraced the respective buttons and changed the “href” tag value for the correct name of the page that I would link it to. JavaScript is also a problem before sometimes it suddenly overrides the existing responsive CSS styles specially in the Cart part. 

Here is the color palette in case:
            --primary-color: #387478;
            --secondary-color: #6A9C89;
            --light-color: #ffffff;
            --dark-color: #000000;
            --gray-text: #666666;
            --light-gray: #f8f9fa;
